# hate-detector Project Organization

## Dataset
The dataset files ```dev_en.tsv, dev_es.tsv, tra_en.tsv, and tra_es.tsv``` must be located in ```hate-detector/nlp516/dataset/development/```.

These files are not included in the github repository because they are restricted to project participants.

## Development code
Code that was used in initial experiments is included in ```hate-detector/dev_playgound``` and ```hate-detector/notebooks```.

This is included in our repository for the purposes of sharing between the team, and is not meant as a working product.


## Delivery code
Our core code for stage 1 is included in ```hate-detector/nlp516```. This portion is organized as follows:

* data.py - Reads in the development dataset and performs preprocessing including stemming.
* main.py - Runs all tests and produces output file results.txt
* model.py - Creates a class for combining vectorizors and classifiers
* vectorizer.py - Defines vectorizors including doc2vec, unigram, and unigram presence
